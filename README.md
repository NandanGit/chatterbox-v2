# ChatterBox
ChatterBox is a FullStack application which is *going to*
make use of Node.js, Express.js, Websockets (socket.io)
for the server side code, MongoDB with mongoose for database 
and finally React.js for the Look and feel of the application

The application is currently a work in progress :crossed_fingers:
